# Used libraries
* [chrome-webstore-upload](https://github.com/fregante/chrome-webstore-upload)

# Notes about versions
## Firefox scheme
Firefox doesn't allow signing multiple versions with the same version number. Since we release the app both in the
asset store and in the GitHub releases, we have to use a different version number for each one.

`.0` suffix is used for the asset store, and `.1` for the GitHub releases.

# Changelog

* Added direct links for iCalendar for [UPV_iCal-ColorFix](https://github.com/ArnyminerZ/UPV_iCal-ColorFix).
## 1.0.2
* Fixed a missing `%` in the approved students row.
## 1.0.1 - Localization
Added localized messages in Catalan and Spanish.
